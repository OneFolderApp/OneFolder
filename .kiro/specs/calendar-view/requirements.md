# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The calendar view feature will provide users with a chronological way to browse their photo collection, similar to Apple Photos and Google Photos. This view will organize images by date created, displaying them in a smartphone-like interface with month/year headers and thumbnail grids below each time period. The feature will enable intuitive navigation through time periods and provide smooth scrolling performance even with large photo collections.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my photos organized by date in a calendar-style layout, so that I can easily browse my collection chronologically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects the calendar view THEN the system SHALL display photos grouped by month and year
2. WHEN photos exist for a time period THEN the system SHALL show a month/year header followed by thumbnail images from that period
3. WHEN no photos exist for a time period THEN the system SHALL NOT display that time period
4. WHEN photos are displayed THEN they SHALL be sorted by date created within each month group

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate through different time periods efficiently, so that I can quickly find photos from specific dates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user scrolls through the calendar view THEN the system SHALL provide smooth scrolling performance
2. WHEN the user has a large photo collection THEN the system SHALL use virtualization to maintain performance
3. WHEN the user scrolls THEN only visible and near-visible content SHALL be rendered
4. WHEN the user navigates to a different view and returns THEN the system SHALL preserve the scroll position

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the calendar view to integrate seamlessly with existing app functionality, so that I can perform all standard operations on my photos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on a photo THEN the system SHALL select the photo using existing selection logic
2. WHEN the user uses keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL support arrow key navigation between photos
3. WHEN the user performs multi-select operations THEN the system SHALL support Ctrl+click and Shift+click selection
4. WHEN the user right-clicks THEN the system SHALL show the standard context menu
5. WHEN the user double-clicks a photo THEN the system SHALL enter slide mode

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the calendar view to display photos with appropriate visual hierarchy, so that I can easily distinguish between different time periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying time periods THEN the system SHALL show month and year headers with clear visual separation
2. WHEN displaying photos THEN the system SHALL use consistent thumbnail sizing with the rest of the app
3. WHEN displaying month groups THEN the system SHALL use appropriate spacing and padding for readability
4. WHEN the user changes thumbnail size THEN the calendar view SHALL respond to the global thumbnail size setting

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the calendar view to handle edge cases gracefully, so that the interface remains stable and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are no photos in the collection THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state
2. WHEN photos have missing or invalid date metadata THEN the system SHALL group them in a fallback category
3. WHEN the window is resized THEN the system SHALL recalculate layout appropriately
4. WHEN switching between view modes THEN the system SHALL maintain selection state where possible

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the calendar view to be performant with large collections, so that I can browse thousands of photos without lag.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the collection contains thousands of photos THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth scrolling performance
2. WHEN rendering photos THEN the system SHALL only render items within the viewport plus a reasonable overscan
3. WHEN grouping photos by date THEN the system SHALL perform grouping efficiently without blocking the UI
4. WHEN the user scrolls rapidly THEN the system SHALL handle scroll events without performance degradation
