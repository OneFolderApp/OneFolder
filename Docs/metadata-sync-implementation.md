# Metadata Sync Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation of immediate metadata synchronization between OneFolder's database and image file metadata, replacing the current manual export workflow.

## Overview

**Goal**: Keep OneFolder's database and image metadata in perfect sync by writing changes immediately when users modify tags, while maintaining smooth UX.

**Strategy**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED** - Immediate sync with debouncing and error handling works perfectly.

**Status**: Phase 1 complete with performance optimizations - tested and optimized for large libraries.

---

## üö® **Performance Issue & Resolution (v1.0.24 ‚Üí v1.0.25)**

### **Issue Identified**

- **Symptoms**: High CPU usage (50%), high RAM (1GB), very slow sync (5-10 mins ‚Üí 40 mins)
- **Root Cause**: Every tag change spawned individual ExifTool processes without batching
- **Impact**: Bulk operations created hundreds/thousands of concurrent ExifTool processes

### **‚úÖ Performance Fixes Applied**

1. **Debouncing Mechanism**:

   - Added 300ms debounce to `scheduleMetadataWrite()` in `File.ts`
   - Multiple rapid tag changes now batch into single write operation
   - Prevents cascading ExifTool processes during bulk operations

2. **Parallel Processing Optimization**:

   - Updated `readTagsFromFiles()` to use parallel processing with concurrency limit (3)
   - Replaced sequential file processing with `promiseAllLimit()`
   - Significantly improved bulk tag reading performance

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Improved retry mechanism to prevent error cascading
   - Better cleanup of pending operations during bulk mode

---

## Current State Analysis

### What's Currently Optimized

```typescript
// In src/frontend/entities/File.ts - ClientFile.addTag()
this.scheduleMetadataWrite(); // ‚úÖ DEBOUNCED AND BATCHED!
```

### Why The Original Implementation Had Issues

1. **No Debouncing**: Each tag change = new ExifTool process
2. **Sequential Processing**: Bulk operations processed files one by one
3. **Error Cascading**: Failed retries multiplied the load

---

## ‚úÖ **Current Implementation (Phase 1 + Performance Fixes)**

### **Immediate Sync with Debouncing**

- **Immediate UI Update**: Tags appear instantly in OneFolder ‚úÖ
- **Debounced File Write**: Metadata written after 300ms delay to batch rapid changes ‚úÖ
- **Performance**: Tested with large libraries - restored to original speed ‚úÖ

### **Bulk Operations Optimization**

- **Parallel Processing**: `readTagsFromFiles()` uses concurrency limit of 3 ‚úÖ
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates during bulk operations ‚úÖ
- **Resource Management**: Prevents system overload during large operations ‚úÖ

### **Error Handling**

- **Silent Success**: No notification when writes succeed ‚úÖ
- **Visible Failures**: Toast notification with retry option ‚úÖ
- **Graceful Degradation**: App continues working even if file writes fail ‚úÖ
- **Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of pending operations during bulk mode ‚úÖ

### **Bug Fixes Applied**

- **Clear Tags Fix**: Removing all tags now properly clears file metadata ‚úÖ
- **Performance Regression Fix**: Debouncing prevents excessive ExifTool processes ‚úÖ
- **Bulk Operations Fix**: Parallel processing instead of sequential ‚úÖ

### **User Experience**

- ‚úÖ **Success**: Silent background sync with optimal performance
- ‚ùå **Failures**: Toast notifications like "Failed to sync tags for IMG_001.jpg [Retry]"
- ‚úÖ **Bulk Operations**: Fast parallel processing with progress indicators

---

## ‚úÖ **Completed Implementation**

### Phase 1: Immediate Sync ‚úÖ

1. ‚úÖ Uncommented `writeTags()` calls in `File.ts`
2. ‚úÖ Added error handling with toast notifications and retry
3. ‚úÖ Fixed clear tags bug in `ExifIO.ts`

### Phase 2: Performance Optimization ‚úÖ

1. ‚úÖ Added debouncing mechanism to prevent excessive ExifTool processes
2. ‚úÖ Optimized bulk tag reading with parallel processing
3. ‚úÖ Enhanced error handling and cleanup
4. ‚úÖ Tested with large libraries - performance restored

## üöÄ **Performance Characteristics**

### **Individual Tag Changes**

- **Debounce Delay**: 300ms (allows batching of rapid changes)
- **Resource Usage**: Minimal - single ExifTool process per batch
- **User Experience**: Instant UI feedback, silent background sync

### **Bulk Operations**

- **Concurrency Limit**: 3 parallel ExifTool processes
- **Progress Updates**: Real-time percentage display
- **Memory Usage**: Controlled and optimized

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

- **`src/frontend/entities/File.ts`**:

  - Added debouncing mechanism (`scheduleMetadataWrite()`)
  - Enhanced `disableImmediateSync()` to handle pending operations
  - Improved error handling in retry logic

- **`src/frontend/stores/FileStore.ts`**:

  - Optimized `readTagsFromFiles()` with parallel processing
  - Added concurrency limit to prevent system overload
  - Enhanced progress tracking

- **`common/ExifIO.ts`**: Fixed clear tags bug - properly clears metadata when no tags remain

### Key Features

- **Debounced Writes**: 300ms delay batches rapid tag changes
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent operations with resource limits
- **Error Handling**: Toast notifications with retry for failed writes
- **Performance**: Optimized for both individual changes and bulk operations
- **Reliability**: App continues working even if file writes fail
